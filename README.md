A decentralized content distribution platform where each copy of the content behaves as unique entities, enabling characteristic properties and behaviors. 




A defining property of the realm of atoms is that each entity is unique, and making exact replicas of an entity becomes virtually impossible. Making similar copies are energy-intesive too. This is why two paperback copies of the same book or two DVDs of the same movie are unique entities, even if the content in them are identical. 

This uniqueness vanishes in the realm of bits. Two ebook files of the same book are exactly the same, and behave exactly the same way. There's no way to differentiate them.

It is this fundamental property that drives people to stand in queue for days for the 1st iPhone, while there's no queue (or any special behavior) to get the first digital copy of Avengers: Endgame. Atoms are scarce, bits are not.

This project is a way to build digital scarcity on to the realm of bits, while keeping the best bits (pun intended) intact.

ERC-721 Non-fungibe tokens seemed like the obvious answer. Whenever a buyer buys content from the publisher/producer, a new token is minted and the buyer is assigned as its owner. Token owners will have access to consume the content. And token owners can sell/give their tokens to anyone they wish to, at prices they want. So each copy of the same content behave like unique entities, with their own unique history of past owners and sale prices etc. 

A token owner will have the ability to rent the content too, making this a revenue stream for the content owner. Since content owners of the same content will be competing to rent their tokens, open-market dynamics will kick in and unique behaviors and phenomena will emerge.

The content producer/publisher is incentivized through transaction commissions. The producer gets a cut of the price for every further transactions after the primary sale. Be it a secondary sale or a rent, the content producer gets a predefined percentage of the price, no matter how high/low a particular copy is sold/rented at.

The producer/publisher can further generate revenue through special editions and premiums for the first copies. It's a safe bet to assume that the 1st digital copy of Avengers: Endgame would fetch more than $50. 

Everyone involved would stand to gain from an ecosystem such as this.
